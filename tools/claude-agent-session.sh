# Attach to (or inspect) Claude issue-agent sessions running on the
# homelab fleet's ephemeral JIT runners (jlapenna/agent-lcars's
# apps/runner-autoscaler, homelab#97). The agent advertises the exact
# `resume` command for its run in its first issue comment, so the
# maintainer can paste it to take over. See .github/workflows/claude.yml.
#
# Runners are single-job, torn-down-at-completion containers named
# `runner-<scale-set>-<uuid8>` (apps/runner-autoscaler/scaler.go),
# scheduled onto whichever of the fleet's hosts
# (homelab/pike/laforge/spark/janeway) the autoscaler picks -- there is
# no single local docker daemon to query. This fans discovery out over
# SSH to every configured fleet host, the same way the autoscaler
# control plane itself reaches them (apps/runner-autoscaler/hosts.go),
# but using the OPERATOR's own already-authorized homelab-user SSH
# access, not the control plane's own dedicated fleet automation key
# (which only that container can read).
#
# Fleet-canonical copy (agent-lcars#1307; it started life in
# supersprinklesracing/sprinkles as members#3407): jlapenna/homelab and
# sprinkles vendor this file byte-for-byte -- all three repos share the
# identical fleet -- and the verify-fleet-scripts published action fails
# their CI when a vendored copy drifts. Edit it HERE and re-sync the
# consumers. The per-repo differences (scale set, checkout path,
# transcripts bucket, extra hosts) are exactly the CLAUDE_* defaults
# below: a consumer overrides them in a sibling claude-agent-session.conf,
# never by editing its copy of this script.
#
# claude-code-action (the GitHub Action claude.yml uses to actually run
# Claude) does not leave a standalone `claude` CLI on PATH inside the
# container -- it drives its own bundled bun/TypeScript engine instead.
# `resume` below installs a fresh copy via `npx` (Node IS baked into the
# runner image) rather than assuming a pre-installed binary; this is a
# different process than the one that wrote the transcript, but Claude
# Code's session storage under ~/.claude/projects is CLI-version-agnostic,
# the same way resuming a local session after upgrading `claude` works.
#
# `resume-archive` is a separate, fleet-independent path for a run whose
# container is already gone: claude.yml's "Finalize telemetry sidecar"
# step archives the raw transcript to GCS and records its gs:// URI on
# the session's Firestore doc (transcriptGcsUri) once the job ends. This
# subcommand restores that archived transcript into the CURRENT
# checkout's local ~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/ dir so
# `claude --resume <session-id>` works here, on the workstation -- entirely
# unaffected by the fleet topology, since it never touches a runner host.

Usage: $(basename "$0") <command> [session-id]

Commands:
  list                    List live agent sessions across the fleet (newest first)
  tail [id]               Live-tail a session transcript (defaults to newest anywhere)
  resume [id]             Take over a session interactively (defaults to newest)
  resume-archive <uri|id> Restore an archived GCS transcript into this checkout's
                          local ~/.claude/projects/ dir, then print the
                          'claude --resume' line for it (for a run whose
                          runner container is already gone)

A session only shows up in 'list'/'tail'/'resume' while its runner
container is still alive -- ephemeral JIT runners are torn down
immediately at job end. For a finished run, use 'resume-archive' instead.

Auth for resume, in order of preference:
  1. CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN in the environment
  2. Token file: $TOKEN_FILE  (mint one with: claude setup-token)
  3. Neither: Claude Code prompts /login inside the container (credentials
     then persist in that container until it is torn down at job end)

resume-archive usage:
  $(basename "$0") resume-archive gs://$TRANSCRIPTS_BUCKET/runs/<run-id>/<session-id>.jsonl
  $(basename "$0") resume-archive <run-id>
    Bare numeric run ids are expanded by listing
    gs://$TRANSCRIPTS_BUCKET/runs/<run-id>/ for its *.jsonl file; if more
    than one is found, they are listed and you must pass the full URI.
  Requires 'gcloud' with read access to the transcripts bucket. Downloads
  into ~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/ for the CURRENT working directory
  (the slug Claude Code itself uses: '/' and '.' in \$PWD replaced with '-').
  Re-running with the same transcript is a no-op; downloading a different
  transcript over an existing same-named file is refused rather than
  overwritten.
